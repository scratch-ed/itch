// Again, key movement problem.
// However, we need more tools to coordinate with the different sprites:
// While testing "Roy", we need to test the "Ton" and "Rob" sprites at the
// same time, as they both also move.
// An alternative would be to do "three" runs, in which we each test
// one sprite, and somehow control the others.
